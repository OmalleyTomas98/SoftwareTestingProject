The Risks/Assumptions



\centerline{Contingency plan for unexpected Bugs}



\begin{itemize}

	\item A risk is the chance, high or low, that any hazard will actually cause somebody harm. 


	\item An assumption is a thing that is accepted as true or as certain to happen, without proof.


  \item Through testing it was found during intergation that the user may be able to get unlimited health if the user hits the enenie while in an invincible mode.This bug has delayed our team and we must re schedule the unit testing for another week until this severe bug is fixed.

  \item I believe ya the team will be able to finish up by the scheduled beta testing period which is in month 4 we have set a contingency plan where developers can help eachother when they have completed their test cases.



  \item From the positive test cases create and monitored we can assume the game is near ready to be deployed to the public. 

  \item A large risk for us would be to not collobarate together to effectively test all areas e.g to test on android instead of both IOS and Android.
