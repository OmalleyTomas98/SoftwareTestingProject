}

\begin{enumerate}
   \item Performance Testing 
   \begin{itemize}
     \item  In Modern computer systems we have an excess of power e.g in cores ,RAM (Random Access memory) , violtile memory etc.2D games are not demanding to run on modern systems and 2d games have been popular on computers since the 1960s.
   \end{itemize}
  
  \item Stress Testing
   \begin{itemize}
     \item Stress testing is a type of software testing that verifies the stability and reliability of the system. It is evident the game is very light in terms of computationally power and trying to play the game for hours would be extremely unproductive.

   \end{itemize}

     \item Multiple Mobile Platforms
   \begin{itemize}
     \item We will not test this game for multiple smartphones platforms e.g Apple (Ios) and Android . Smartphones have near identcial architecture and we can presume with high levels of confidence that this game will show the same behaviour indpendent of the Operating System.
   \end{itemize}



 \item Usability testing
   \begin{itemize}
 	\item 
 	 Testing for user-friendliness is clearly subjective and will depend on the targeted end-user or customer.Nearly all computer/mobile games use the most common movement systems e.g WASD and Gestures.We  are highly confident the user experience is tradational and usability testing would be redundent.
