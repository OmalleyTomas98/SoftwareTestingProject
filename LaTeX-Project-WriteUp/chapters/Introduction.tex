Welcome to my Test case documentation for the latest game developed by Game Development International Ltd .
The company provided me with a short brief informing me on the features/fundamentals to their new game title.
The product developed by  Game Development International Ltd is a 2D side scrolling platformer which borrows
behaviors from other titles such as 'Shovel knight' to 'Skyrim'. Here are a list of the characteristics/functions
set in their title.

\centerline{Game fundamentals}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Allow the player to control a specific character, that has an important
fictional/narrative role.
  \item Have game statistics and/or relational attributes with other game objects, enemies,
and/or the player character.

\item Allow the player to take on and navigate the levels using an easy-to-use user
interface.

\item Have obstacles that the player must overcome, such as enemies and bosses.
\end{enumerate}

The game holds a rich number of features and should give me the opportunity to create lots of different tests.
