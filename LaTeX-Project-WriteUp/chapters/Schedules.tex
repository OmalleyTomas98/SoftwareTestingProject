Scheduling in project management is the listing of activities, deliverables, and milestones within a project. A schedule also usually includes the planned start and finish date, duration, and resources assigned to each activity. Effective project scheduling is a critical component of successful time management.

Scheduling was a very difficult area to manage when testing their product. We had to create an
incremental approach starting with the bare bones of the Product and working from the ground up
e.g testing the transition from Start menu to the in-game. Underneath are Schedules created during
testing.
