\subsection{Unit Testing}
Unit Testing is a level of software testing where individual units/components of a software are tested. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. In procedural programming, a unit may be an individual program, function, procedure,etc.\\

The unit Testing will be carried out by myself (Tomas O'Malley).I plan to create test scripts using automated tools such as selenium to for example test the in game menus.\\

\subsection{System and Integration Testing}
System Integration Testing is defined as a type of software testing carried out in an integrated hardware and software environment to verify the behaviour of the complete system.It is testing conducted on a complete, integrated system to evaluate the system's compliance with its specified requirement.\\

System  and Integration Testing will be carried out by John Smith.John tested each component in the game by manually testing inputs into the game e.g Testing the save game function from in game and pre game menus.\\ 

\subsection{Performance and Stress Testing}
Performance testing is carried out to check the system's performance under varying loads.Stress testing is carried out to check the behaviour of the system under the sudden increased load of the system or software application. It only checks the stability of the system or software application.\\


Performance and Stress Testing will be carried out by Laine Louhglin.Laine carried out the tests by researching the scripts in the game and attacking the game by using scripts to see how many levels of the game can be played before crashing reflecting the game memory allocation.


\subsection{User Acceptance Testing}
User acceptance testing (UAT) is the last phase of the software testing process. During UAT, actual software users test the software to make sure it can handle required tasks in real-world scenarios, according to specifications.\\


User Acceptance Testing will be carried out by Tyler Durden.Tyler tested the product by deploying the game on both mobile and pc platforms to simulate how the game will be interacted with in normal situations like with and without wifi enabled


\subsection{Batch Testing}
Batch testing is a comprehensive test on your current trained model to measure its performance in LUIS. The data sets used for batch testing should not include example utterances in the intents or utterances received from the prediction runtime endpoint.\\



Batch Testing will be carried out by Grace Kelly.Grace used automated tools to test the quality of the product by simulating random events for the product to handle.



\subsection{Automated Regression Testing}
Regression Testing is defined as a type of software testing to confirm that a recent program or code change has not adversely affected existing features. Regression Testing is nothing but a full or partial selection of already executed test cases which are re-executed to ensure existing functionalities work fine.\\


Automated Regression Testing will be carried out by Mia Wallace.Mia wrote a series of tests to make sure previous compoennts did not directly old modules tests on enemies shooting before and after power ups.



\subsection{Beta Testing}
A beta test is a type of testing period for a computer product prior to any sort of commercial or official release. Beta testing is considered the last stage of testing, and normally involves distributing the product to beta test sites and individual users ("beta testers") outside the company for real-world exposure.\\

Beta Testing will be carried out by Jackie Brown.Jackie was responsible for securing a session with a local college to play the product.Jackie asked many questions and reported back to the scrum master.
