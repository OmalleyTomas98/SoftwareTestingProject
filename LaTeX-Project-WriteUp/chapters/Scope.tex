Game Development International Ltd has rich catalogue of features in their game which I cover briefly in
the Introduction.
\subsection{General}
Here are some of the technical features
\begin{enumerate}
  \item    \textbf{Menu Systems :}  Test the products menu such as the start  pause menu screens
  \item    \textbf{In game controls :} Test the basic used to interact with the game e.g W- To move forward
  \item     \textbf{Character Attributes :} Test the basic character attributes such as health and points
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Tactics}


All tests will be carried out in Alpha Testing Enviroments.


Alpha testing is a type of acceptance testing; performed to identify all possible issues/bugs before releasing the product to everyday users or the public. ... Alpha testing is carried out in a lab environment and usually, the testers are internal employees of the organization.


The Scope to this approach is to find as many
bugs in the game and understand how these bugs congregate in other areas of the application.
To test all of these existing fubctions I will be incremently testing using a procedural approach for all , An example. When testing the Save Game
I would note the steps taken e.g 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item  Launch game on browser/Unity Etc
	\item  Click PLay Button
	\item Press the pause button in game e.g ESC
	\item  Click the Save Gamwe button listed using mosue or Arrwo keys and press enter button on keyboard
	\item Exit Game by pressing exit button using arrow keys and enter keys 
	\item Click Resume button
	\item If game resumes from save file . Test case is a Pass if not , a fail.

\end{enumerate}
